# portfolio-simple-website1This is a simple personal portfolio website built using HTML and basic CSS.  
The website consists of two pages: Home and Contact.

The Home page introduces who I am and highlights my skills and interests, while the Contact page provides a way to get in touch. The project focuses on clean HTML structure and basic CSS styling without using any frameworks or libraries.

This project helped me strengthen my fundamentals in web development and serves as a base for future improvements.
